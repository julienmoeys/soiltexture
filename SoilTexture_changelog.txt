  20120125 New attempt to fix xtable package dependence in the vignette.

o version 1.2.7 

  20120106  no visible change (fixed package dependance in vignette) + corrected TT.plot()
            example for Spanish language.

o version 1.2.6 

  20111112  Added the German (GDR) texture triangle for forest soils: 
            "Standortserkundungsanweisung SEA 1974 (DE)" 

o older versions

  20111109  New attempt to fix problems while loading the Polish texture triangle 
            under Mac/Darwin and freeBSD.

  20111101  Fixed a potential infinite loop problem in the texture transformation 
            functions based on "drc"

  20111101  Improved handling / loading of the Polish triangle (is not working under 
            Mac). Added the polih triangle to the vignette.

  20100610  New function TT.polygon.centroids() used for a smater calculation 
            of the texture class centroid for better placement of the texture 
            classes labels (used by TT.classes(), itself used by TT.plot()).

  20100607  Added the Romanian texture triangle to the list of pre-defined  texture 
            triangles, and the Romanian language to the list of possible languages 
            for the texture triangle title and axis labels. many thanks to 
            Rosca Bogdan (Romanian Academy, Iasi Branch, Geography team) for providing 
            the code and translation.

  20100513  Accuracy problems detected in TT.points.in.classes() for texture data 
            located right on the boundary of the triangle (or some texture classes), 
            with some digits after the decimal: due to non-exact trigonometric 
            calculations (around 1E-15), these points may not be classified 
            as on the border, or even belonging to the texture class. These 
            accuracy problems can be partially fixed by a new parameter of 
            TT.points.in.classes(), 'texture2xy' that can be set to FALSE in 
            order to get more accurate classifications. Other accuracy problems 
            still remains, but this time in the underlying point.in.polygon() 
            function. There is no easy fix to this:
            <https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2010-May/239035.html>
            No fix are planned in the close future to fix this error.
            Thanks to Wei Shangguan (see below) for pointing this 'bug'.

  20100513  Added the ISSS (not to be confused with the 'Australian ISSS') 
            texture triangle to the 
            list of pre-defined texture triangles. Many thanks to Wei Shangguan, 
            PhD from the School of geography of Beijing normal university 
            for providing the code of the triangle.

  20100416  Added the Canadian texture triangle to the list of pre-defined 
            texture triangles.

  20100409  Created an r-forge page for the package and uploaded it to SCM 
            http://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/?group_id=740 

  20100409  Finished documenting the function TT.plot with inlinedocs. Package 
            successfully compiled.

  20091221  The parameter 'fg' is now defunct, and replaced by 'col' that accepts 
            several values (while fg only accepts one). 'fg' still exists as an 
            option, but shouldn't produce any effect.

  20091119  Simplified some redundant code in TT.css2xy(), the function that 
            transforms clay silt sand data into x-y coordinates.

  20091118  Corrected a bug in the function TT.normalise.sum() (that couldn't 
            handle data.frames)

  20091014  Added the Belgian soil texture triangle to the list of pre-defined
            texture triangles (now 8).

  20091013  The TT.mahalanobis() function can now compute a grid of the Mahalanobis 
            distance on log-ratio trasnformation of soil texture data. New option 
            alr, default = FALSE, can be set to TRUE for alr transformation.

  20091013  Added TT.chemometrics.alr(), for additive log-ratio trasnformation of 
            soil texture data. This is a copy of the alr() function in the chemometrics 
            package, with minor modifications for soil texture data. Used internally 
            in TT.mahalanobis().

  20091011  Added TT.normalise.sum(), that normalise the sum of the 3 texture classes
            to text.sum (100%).

  20091011  The options 'pow' and 'q.max.dist' are now set to 0.5 and 50 respectively.
            This is a stronger smoothing than the previous values.

  20091011  TT.iwd() has now a 'q.max.dist' option user to determin 'max.dist' if this 
            last is set to NULL. max.dist is the maximum euclidian distance, between 
            a grid point and a data point. If the distance between the grid point and 
            the data point is higher than max.dist, this point is not used to calculate 
            the iwd value. max.dist default value is 
            quantile( x = euclidian.distances, probs = q.max.dist ) 
        
  20091011  The option value 'z.type = "map"' is now deprecated in TT.plot(). Replaced
            by TT.iwd() and TT.image(), called outside TT.plot().

  20091011  TT.as.image() internal function deprecated. now inside TT.iwd()

  20091011  TT.image.shade() internal function deprecated. now inside TT.iwd() 

  20091011  TT.iwd.image() renamed to TT.iwd(). The function now output a list with 
            a x y grid and z value matrix, ready to be plotted by TT.image(). The 
            function is not plotting the image any more.

  20091011  TT.iwd() internal function is deprecated. The name will be attributed to 
            TT.iwd.image() 

  20091010  TT.baseplot() now has a geo option.	

  20091010  TT.kde2d() function created. Wrapper for MASS function kde2d(), but 
            customized for texture triangles. Results can be displayed by 
            TT.contour(), TT.image(), contour() or image().

  20091010  TT.image() function created. Wrapped for image(), but customized 
            for texture triangles. Used to display x-y-z list data in the same 
            format as 'x' in contour() or image().

  20091010  TT.contour() function created. Wrapped for contour(), but customized 
            for texture triangles. Used to display x-y-z list data in the same 
            format as 'x' in contour() or image().

  20091010  TT.mahalanobis() function created. Wrapper for the function mahalanobis(), 
            but customized for texture triangles. Results can be displayed by 
            TT.contour(), TT.image() [see above], contour() or image(). Calculates the 
            Mahalanobis distance for 2 of the 3 texture classes, on a regular x-y grid, 
            backtransformed into clay silt sand, used to calculate the Mahalanobis 
            distance.

  20091010  Added TT.xy.grid() that generates a regular grid on the 
            x-y axis. Made after part of kde2d

  20091009  Modified TT.plot() function so it accepts an optionnal 'geo' option and an 
            'add' option that behaves like plot(add=TRUE) when non-null. This is intended 
            to allow overplotting a soil texture triangle over a background plotted by 
            another function (i.e. heat map, contour map etc.)

  20091009  Added TT.locator(). This function is equivalent to the locator() function, 
            except that it returns clay silt sand coordinates instead.

  20091009  Added TT.xy2css() a function to convert x-y coordinates into clay silt sand.

  20091009  renamed TT.arrows() to TT.axis.arrows().
