Description: "The Soil Texture Wizard" is a set of R functions designed to produce 
    texture triangles (also called texture plots, texture diagrams, texture ternary plots), 
    classify and transform soil textures data. These functions virtually allows to plot any 
    soil texture triangle / classification into any triangle geometry (isosceles, 
    right-angled triangles, etc.). This set of function is expected to be useful to people 
    using soil textures data from different soil texture classification or different particle 
    size systems. Several texture triangles are predefined: USDA; FAO (which is also the 
    triangle for the soil map of Europe); Aisne (France); GEPPA (France); German triangles 
    "Bodenkundliche Kartieranleitung 1994", "SEA 1974" and "TGL 1985"; Soil 
    Survey of England and Wales; Australian triangle; Belgian triangle; Canadian triangle; 
    ISSS triangle; Romanian triangle; Polish triangle.
