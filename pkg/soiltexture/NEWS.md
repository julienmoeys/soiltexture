# soiltexture 1.5.2
    
*   Package upgraded to R version 4.3.2

*   Namespace was cleaned up. Internation functions were removed 
    from the namespace.
    
# soiltexture 1.5.1
    
*   2018/09/19  Files languages.rds and triangles.rds 
    re-generated after some issues when runiing tests 
    on Travis CI and AppVeyor. Not sure if that was needed.

    Attempt to make the package running on R >= 3.1.0, 
    rather than the latest version of R (currently R 3.5.0) 
    using Travis CI to test if the package can be 
    installed on that version of R.
        
# soiltexture 1.5.0
    
*   2018/06/28  The file soiltexture-package.Rd is now 
    generated by utils::promptPackage(). It was out 
    of sync with the DESCRIPTION. On a request of CRAN,
    
*   2018/06/27  Added a new clone of the texture triangle 
    CA.EN.TT (here called CA2.EN.TT) with the official 
    texture labels, so it can be used for governmental 
    purpose.
    
# soiltexture 1.4.6
    
*   2017/05/01  The bibTeX file vignettes/soiltexture_vignette.bib 
    was sanitised for non-ascii characters, that 
    were replaced by equivalent LaTeX command. (after 
    a reqtest from CRAN maintainer)
    
# soiltexture 1.4.5
    
*   2017/09/27  Added a field "BugReports" to the package 
    DESCRIPTION, with a link to the package 
    GitHub issue tracing system.
    
# soiltexture 1.4.4
    
*   2017/09/27  Added a new "duplicate" of the USDA 
    soil texture triangle, identical to USDA.TT, 
    except that the labels have been changed to 
    match better class-abbreviations currently used 
    at USDA-NCSS (after a suggestion from Dylan Beaudette, 
    NCSS).
    
# soiltexture 1.4.3

*   2017/03/05 to 2017/03/29
    Added yet several polish texture triangles:
    *   Polish_PTG_1956_Musierowicz.TT
    *   Polish_kategorie_agronomiczne_1990.TT
    *   PTG_2008.TT
        
    All are courtesy of Michal Stepien and Darek Gozdowski.
    
    The following triangles
    *   Polish_PTG_1956_Musierowicz.TT
    *   Polish_BN_1978.TT
    *   Polish_kategorie_agronomiczne_1990.TT
    *   (PTG_2008.TT)?
    
    Now include polish characters (thanks to Michal Stepien). 
    These characters may only be displayed correctly on 
    some platforms.
        
# soiltexture 1.4.2

*   2017/03/05  Add a new polish texture triangle 
    (Polish_BN_1978.TT). Courtesy of 
    Michal Stepien and Darek Gozdowski.
    
    Move the repository from rforge to GitHub.
    Change version control system from subversion to git.
    
# soiltexture 1.4.1

*   2016/06/07  In NAMESPACE / importFrom, use packageVersion instead of 
    packageDescription. Fix .onAttach

# soiltexture 1.4.0 
    
*   2016/04/08  Add many importFrom in the NAMESPACE.
    Package "utils" now not in "Depends" but in "Imports" 
    instead.
    
# soiltexture 1.3.3 
    
*   2015/05/15  Minor changes to the package vignette: 
    * Call to require() (xtable, soiltexture) now replaced 
      by call lo library().
    * Removed a call to .packages() 
      that may cause the package compilation to crash 
      on r-forge (Windows devel).
    
# soiltexture 1.3.2
    
*   2015/04/23  Replaced shell.exec() by browserURL() 
    in soiltexture_gui(). shell.exec() only works 
    on windows.
    
# soiltexture 1.3.1
    
*   2015/04/17  Compiled for R 3.2.0. Inlinedocs 
    documentation still generated with R 3.1.1 
    (inlinedocs 2013.9.3).
    
# soiltexture 1.3.0
    
*   2015/04/11  Implements a new text-based graphical user 
    interface: soiltexture_gui(). The user is guided 
    through a series of simple question to import, 
    plot and classify soil texture data.
    
*   2015/04/12  Many functions have now been classified 
    as "internal" (keywords = internal) in order 
    to simplify the long list of functions in the 
    package help pages
    
# soiltexture 1.2.22
    
*   2015/03/09  Fix package imports from tools and utils.

    from Humberto Gonçalves dos Santos [et al.], 2013. 
    Sistema Brasileiro de Classificação de Solos, 3 ed. rev. 
    ampl. Brasília, DF: Embrapa, 2013.
    Triangle digitization is a courtesy of José Lucas Safanelli 
    and Alexandre ten Caten (UFSC Curitibanos, Brasil)
    
    Added a long list of contributors to the package DESCRIPTION, 
    that now includes all the people who have helped including 
    and digitizing new texture triangles.
        
# soiltexture 1.2.20

*   2014/10/02  Packages dependencies moved from "Depends" to "Imports"
    in package DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE
    
# soiltexture 1.2.19

*   2014/09/25  Compiled for R 3.1.1
    Attempt to fix imports from tools::package_dependencies
    
# soiltexture 1.2.18
    
*   2014/07/03  Added SVN_VERSION file and show SVN version when 
    the package is attached.

# soiltexture 1.2.17
    
*   2014/07/02  Fixed small bug in the vignette (prevented package
    compilation)

# soiltexture 1.2.16
    
*   2014/06/10  New attempt to fix special characters in languages
    and triangles

# soiltexture 1.2.15

*   2014/06/09  Added texture triangle from Lemos & Santos (1996) 
    (Brasilian triangle). Courtesy of Rodolfo Marcondes 
    Silva Souza, UFPE, Brasil. Code BRASIL.TT
    
    Now support Portuguese language (lang = "pt")
    
    Modified the way to handle languages and triangles 
    with special characters, but it seems R still 
    remove some of the characters
                
# soiltexture 1.2.14

*   2014/04/23  Added texture triangle from Whitney 1911 (USDA)
    (courtesy of Nic Jelinski, University of Minnesota, 
    USA)

# soiltexture 1.2.13

*   2014/01/10  A mistake has been corrected in the texture triangle 
    DE.SEA74.TT (Standortserkundungsanweisung SEA 1974 (DE)), 
    for classes "lehmiger Ton" (lT) and "schluffiger 
    Ton" (uT), where a missing vertex has been added.

# soiltexture 1.2.12

*   2014/01/09  The triangle named FAO50.TT was in fact erroneously 
    named, as it is the HYPRES / European Soil Map 
    texture triangle. The option class.sys = "FAO50.TT" 
    is now giving a warning, and the new option is 
    class.sys = "HYPRES.TT". See the vignette for 
    details.

# soiltexture 1.2.11

*   2014/01/08 Compiled under R 3.0.2
    
    The functions: TT.check.ps.lim.Xm() and 
    TT.text.transf.Xm() have been moved to the package 
    soiltexturetransformation, available on r-forge
    (https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=740)
    
    The polish triangle is now loaded at startup, but 
    loading occur within a try() statement, to (try to) 
    prevent possible encoding problems on some platforms.
    A message is issued if the triangle was not loaded 
    properly (but no error or warning).

# soiltexture 1.2.10

*   2013/04/29 Compiled under R 3.0.0

# soiltexture 1.2.9 

*   20120307 Removed a useless usage of installed.packages() 
*   20120308 Compact the vignettes before R CMD build 

# soiltexture 1.2.8 

*   20120125 New attempt to fix xtable package dependence in the vignette.

# soiltexture 1.2.7 

*   20120106  no visible change (fixed package dependance in vignette) + corrected TT.plot()
    example for Spanish language.

# soiltexture 1.2.6 

*   20111112  Added the German (GDR) texture triangle for forest soils: 
    "Standortserkundungsanweisung SEA 1974 (DE)" 

# soiltexture < 1.2.6

*   20111109  New attempt to fix problems while loading the Polish texture triangle 
    under Mac/Darwin and freeBSD.

*   20111101  Fixed a potential infinite loop problem in the texture transformation 
    functions based on "drc"

*   20111101  Improved handling / loading of the Polish triangle (is not working under 
    Mac). Added the polih triangle to the vignette.

*   20100610  New function TT.polygon.centroids() used for a smater calculation 
    of the texture class centroid for better placement of the texture 
    classes labels (used by TT.classes(), itself used by TT.plot()).

*   20100607  Added the Romanian texture triangle to the list of pre-defined  texture 
    triangles, and the Romanian language to the list of possible languages 
    for the texture triangle title and axis labels. many thanks to 
    Rosca Bogdan (Romanian Academy, Iasi Branch, Geography team) for providing 
    the code and translation.

*   20100513  Accuracy problems detected in TT.points.in.classes() for texture data 
    located right on the boundary of the triangle (or some texture classes), 
    with some digits after the decimal: due to non-exact trigonometric 
    calculations (around 1E-15), these points may not be classified 
    as on the border, or even belonging to the texture class. These 
    accuracy problems can be partially fixed by a new parameter of 
    TT.points.in.classes(), 'texture2xy' that can be set to FALSE in 
    order to get more accurate classifications. Other accuracy problems 
    still remains, but this time in the underlying point.in.polygon() 
    function. There is no easy fix to this:
    <https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2010-May/239035.html>
    No fix are planned in the close future to fix this error.
    Thanks to Wei Shangguan (see below) for pointing this 'bug'.

*   20100513  Added the ISSS (not to be confused with the 'Australian ISSS') 
    texture triangle to the 
    list of pre-defined texture triangles. Many thanks to Wei Shangguan, 
    PhD from the School of geography of Beijing normal university 
    for providing the code of the triangle.

*   20100416  Added the Canadian texture triangle to the list of pre-defined 
    texture triangles.

*   20100409  Created an r-forge page for the package and uploaded it to SCM 
    http://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/?group_id=740 

*   20100409  Finished documenting the function TT.plot with inlinedocs. Package 
    successfully compiled.

*   20091221  The parameter 'fg' is now defunct, and replaced by 'col' that accepts 
    several values (while fg only accepts one). 'fg' still exists as an 
    option, but shouldn't produce any effect.

*   20091119  Simplified some redundant code in TT.css2xy(), the function that 
    transforms clay silt sand data into x-y coordinates.

*   20091118  Corrected a bug in the function TT.normalise.sum() (that couldn't 
    handle data.frames)

*   20091014  Added the Belgian soil texture triangle to the list of pre-defined
    texture triangles (now 8).

*   20091013  The TT.mahalanobis() function can now compute a grid of the Mahalanobis 
    distance on log-ratio trasnformation of soil texture data. New option 
    alr, default = FALSE, can be set to TRUE for alr transformation.

*   20091013  Added TT.chemometrics.alr(), for additive log-ratio trasnformation of 
    soil texture data. This is a copy of the alr() function in the chemometrics 
    package, with minor modifications for soil texture data. Used internally 
    in TT.mahalanobis().

*   20091011  Added TT.normalise.sum(), that normalise the sum of the 3 texture classes
    to text.sum (100%).

*   20091011  The options 'pow' and 'q.max.dist' are now set to 0.5 and 50 respectively.
    This is a stronger smoothing than the previous values.

*   20091011  TT.iwd() has now a 'q.max.dist' option user to determin 'max.dist' if this 
    last is set to NULL. max.dist is the maximum euclidian distance, between 
    a grid point and a data point. If the distance between the grid point and 
    the data point is higher than max.dist, this point is not used to calculate 
    the iwd value. max.dist default value is 
    quantile( x = euclidian.distances, probs = q.max.dist ) 
        
*   20091011  The option value 'z.type = "map"' is now deprecated in TT.plot(). Replaced
    by TT.iwd() and TT.image(), called outside TT.plot().

*   20091011  TT.as.image() internal function deprecated. now inside TT.iwd()

*   20091011  TT.image.shade() internal function deprecated. now inside TT.iwd() 

*   20091011  TT.iwd.image() renamed to TT.iwd(). The function now output a list with 
    a x y grid and z value matrix, ready to be plotted by TT.image(). The 
    function is not plotting the image any more.

*   20091011  TT.iwd() internal function is deprecated. The name will be attributed to 
    TT.iwd.image() 

*   20091010  TT.baseplot() now has a geo option.	

*   20091010  TT.kde2d() function created. Wrapper for MASS function kde2d(), but 
    customized for texture triangles. Results can be displayed by 
    TT.contour(), TT.image(), contour() or image().

*   20091010  TT.image() function created. Wrapped for image(), but customized 
    for texture triangles. Used to display x-y-z list data in the same 
    format as 'x' in contour() or image().

*   20091010  TT.contour() function created. Wrapped for contour(), but customized 
    for texture triangles. Used to display x-y-z list data in the same 
    format as 'x' in contour() or image().

*   20091010  TT.mahalanobis() function created. Wrapper for the function mahalanobis(), 
    but customized for texture triangles. Results can be displayed by 
    TT.contour(), TT.image() (see above), contour() or image(). Calculates the 
    Mahalanobis distance for 2 of the 3 texture classes, on a regular x-y grid, 
    backtransformed into clay silt sand, used to calculate the Mahalanobis 
    distance.

*   20091010  Added TT.xy.grid() that generates a regular grid on the 
    x-y axis. Made after part of kde2d

*   20091009  Modified TT.plot() function so it accepts an optionnal 'geo' option and an 
    'add' option that behaves like plot(add=TRUE) when non-null. This is intended 
    to allow overplotting a soil texture triangle over a background plotted by 
    another function (i.e. heat map, contour map etc.)

*   20091009  Added TT.locator(). This function is equivalent to the locator() function, 
    except that it returns clay silt sand coordinates instead.

*   20091009  Added TT.xy2css() a function to convert x-y coordinates into clay silt sand.

*   20091009  renamed TT.arrows() to TT.axis.arrows().

*   20091009  CHANGE LOG STARTED
